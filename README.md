This repository contains the development of a tournament management system, intended for groups of friends who want to carry out soccer tournaments, video games or other tournaments.

Through this system they will be able to register all the players they want and they will be able to select the characteristics of the tournament such as round-trip matches, times, prizes and many more options.


This project is being developed with the aim of facilitating tournaments between friends, since in my case on many occasions my friends and I hold tournaments and there are always difficulties in managing it.
